  Dancing Mountain Arts is my creative expression. I enjoy a variety of artistic
  expression from working in copper to teaching dance. On these pages you will
  find one of a kind pieces of art. There are no templates, jigs or patterns.
  Each piece is created freehand, so each piece is unique.

Dancing Mountain Arts is my creative expression. I enjoy a variety of artistic expression from working in copper to teaching dance. On these pages you will find one of a kind pieces of art. There are no templates, jigs or patterns. Each piece is created freehand, so each piece is unique.

I hope you enjoy looking at my work. I enjoyed creating them. --- Jeanne
